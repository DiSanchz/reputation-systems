# single product analysis
Dynamic Structural Modeling and Approximate Bayesian Inference of Online Reputation Systems
In single product analysis we generate the traning samples conditioned on the parameters of a single product.
The parameters include price, features and the final average quality, which is our proxy for the true qualiyt of the product. 
We model consumer's choice of other products as an outside option, when they are making purchase decisions. 
The consumers for a perception of the product quality based on the observed histogram we estimate the percieved quality using MCMC.
The rating decisions are driven by the diffrerence between the percieved quality and the observed histogram.  
We test the behavior of consumers as they rate the products.  How do people decide whether to leave a review in the platform or not?
We test for non-neagtive threshold behavior in the consumers' decision function.
