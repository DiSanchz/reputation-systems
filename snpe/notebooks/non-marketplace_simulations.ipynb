    "In this notebook you will see how to run the four classes of non-marketplace simulations. The factor that differentiates these simulations is the number of Rho and Herding parameters considered in each of them. At this point it might be useful to formulate a brief reminder about the nature of the aforementioned parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Rho (ρ)__: Represents the cost of posting a rating measured in terms of the difference between the expected product experience and the actual product experience. The higher Rho is, the higher the difference between the expected and the actual experience will have to be for the user to leave a review about the product. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Herding parameter__: A product-specific measurement of the probability of exhibiting herding behavior (i.e. be influenced by previous users' reviews at the time of posting a review). The higher that the herding parameter is, the more likely it is that the review of a user will be influenced by all previously posted reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, there are four different classes of non-marketplace simulations of increasing complexity defined by the number of Rho and herding parameters considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Single Rho Simulation__: It is represented by the SingleRhoSimulator class. This configuration considers the inclussion of a unique value for the rho paramter that is prevalent whether the actual product exprience was better or worse than expected. This implies that the cost of rating is the same irrespective of the sentiment behind such rating.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Double Rho Simulation__: It is represented by the DoubleRhoSimulator class, which is a child class of the single SingleRhoSImulator. This kind of simulation allows for the existence of two different rho parameters. One of these will apply for the cases when the the difference between the actual and the expected product experience is positive (denoted as ρ+) while the other applies in those cases where such difference is negative (denoted as ρ-). This kind of simulation allows you to consider different costs for leaving a review depending on the sentiment (positive/negative) behind it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Herding Simulation__: It is represented by the HerdingSimulator class, which is a child class of the DoubleRhoSimulation class. It adds a herding parameter to the Double Rho Simulation. Now in case that a given user decides to leave a review, (i.e. the difference between the actual and the expected product experience is larger than corresponding rho parameter) it will be subject to a given probability of exhibiting herding behaviour while doing so.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Double Herding Simulation__: It is represented by the DoubleHerdingSimulator class which is a child of the HerdingSimulatorClass. A second product-specific herding parameter is included. One of the herding parameters will apply when the visitor's intended rating is above a given metric of choice (the mode and the mean are contemplated) of the previously existing rating, while the other applies when the intended rating is below such metric. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to see more in detail these different simulator classes you can visit the \"simulator_class.py\" file located in \"snpe/snpe/simulations/\" inside the repo, where you will find the code behind these classes.\n"

    "Finally we can run the simulation by calling the \"generate_and_save\" function providing the desired parameters. In the example below a Double herding simulation of the timeseries type is carried out for ten consumers. Five ratings (one for each rating value) are pre-loaded, the tendency to rate is set at 5%, the mode (of all previous ratings) is taken as the reference metric for herding while the threshold for the doubleherding is determined by the mean (of al previous ratings). Lastly, 5 is the minimum number of previous reviews required for herding. (Given that we are already providing 5 ratings to begin with, herding will be possible from the start of the simulation). "
