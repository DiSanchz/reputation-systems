    "While non-marketplace simulations are focused on a number of consumers experiencing and leaving ratings of a single product, marketplace simulations allow to conduct a similar excercise but including a whole range of ___P___ different products from which consumers can choose between. Accordingly the journey of virtual consumers through the marketplace simulation will be in part similar to that of a non-marketplace one, with the main difference that now each of them will have to choose which particular product to buy from those available. Once this selection process takes place the consumer goes through the rest of the steps that will determine whether a rating is posted or not (formulating expectations, experiencing the product etc.). Moreover multiple marketplaces can be included in a single simulation so you can think of a marketplace simulation as being composed of ___M___ different marketplaces, including  ___P___ different simulated products each from which simulated consumers are able to choose.\n"

    "Below you can find a review of the arguments required to carry out the simulation but that are not exclusive of the marketplace-simulations. Their functioning and interpretation is exactly the same as for non-marketplace simulations except for the 'review_prior' argument, whose interpretation differs intuitively in the sense that in does not only apply to the single product considered in a non-marketplace simulation, but to all products accross all marketplaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __review_prior__: Set of initial ratings for the products that are pre-loaded before the simulation starts, taking the shape of an array of five integer values. By default this is set as an array os five 1s. This implies that by the time a product within a marketplace is purchased for the first time, the consumer that has done so will observe 5 prior reviews, each of them assigned to one of the five values composing the rating scale [1 - 5]. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __tendency_to_rate__: Underliying tendency to rate for all consumers taking float values in the interval [0,1]. In other words, this is the proportion of consumers that will post a rating regardless of the value of the rho parameter(s) and the difference between their actual and expected product experience. If set at the default value of 0.05, 5% of all consumers will post a rating independently of the other factors at play in the simulation.This is necessary to address the \"cold start\" problem where by random chance for some products, we might have high enough values of rho that no visitors ever leave a rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __simulation_type__: Type of simulation output to produce between timeseries and histogram. Accepts the strings \"timeseries\" and \"histogram\" as inputs. Returns the timeseries of the simulated ratings, in a cumulative histogram format (so, the order of rating accumulation is preserved) if \"timeseries\" is chosen. For \"histogram\", returns the final histogram of ratings (and throws away the order of rating accumulation). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __previous_rating_measure__: Measure of previous ratings that will be taken as reference when experiencing herding behavior. It can be either the mean, the mode or the latest review posted. For example, if a consumer leaves a rating being subject to herding and this parameter is set as mode, it will herd towards the mode of all previous reviews. This argument is specific of the Herding and Double herding simulations and takes the strings \"mode\", \"mean\" and \"latest\" as valid inputs.\n",

    "- __min_reviews_for_herding__: Minimum number of pre-existing reviews for a consumer to be able to be subject to herding behavior. It has to be an integer value larger than 0. This argument is specific of the Herding and Double herding simulations."
